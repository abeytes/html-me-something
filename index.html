                    <p><b>Kerry Park</b> is a 1.26-acre (0.51-hectare) park on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill in Seattle, Washington,
                    located at the corner of Second Avenue West and West Highland Drive. According to a plaque on a wall in the
                    park, ""Kerry Park [was] given to the City in 1927 by Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sperry Kerry, Sr., so that all who
                    stop here may enjoy this view." That view encompasses downtown Seattle, Elliott Bay, the West Seattle peninsula,
                    Bainbridge Island, and Mount Rainier

             <p><b>Gas Works park</b> contains remnants of the sole remaining coal gasification plant in the United States. The plant operated from 1906 to 1956 and 
                was bought by the City of Seattle for park purposes in 1962. The park opened to the public in 1975. The park was designed by Seattle landscape
                architect Richard Haag, who won the American Society of Landscape Architects Presidents Award of Design Excellence for the project. It was
                originally named Myrtle Edwards Park, after the city councilwoman who had spearheaded the drive to acquire the site and who died in a car
                 crash in 1969. In 1972, the Edwards family requested that her name be taken off the park because the design called for the retention of much 
                 of the plant. In 1976, Elliott Bay Park, just north of Seattle's Belltown neighborhood, was renamed Myrtle Edwards Park.

                    change on the water and the downtown buildings, you are close to the boat traffic going to and from downtown Seattle, and the
                    of Seattle. And you can wander along the pier and inspect the quiet activity of the local anglers. If you are feeling more active 
                    you can also hire a small boat from the boathouse

                 <p><b>Water Front</b>The park extends from the privately owned Pier 57 to Pier 59, an official city landmark that is the site of the Seattle Aquarium.
                    One of the entrances to the Aquarium is from a viewing platform in the park. The park viewing platforms can be reached both by 
                    stairs and a wheelchair-accessible ramp. The park also features coin-operated telescopes, benches, picnic tables, and some
                    trees in planters. Near the south end of the park, a somewhat larger than life bronze abstract statue of Christopher Columbus
                    ut at the water. Near the picnic tables is Waterfront Fountain, made of cubes cast and welded bronze. The sculpture was work 
                    in progress by artist James FitzGerald at the time of his death. In collaboration with his widow, Margaret Tompkins, it was 
                    completed by Terry Copple.[2]
